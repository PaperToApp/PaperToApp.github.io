Adapting to change quickly: In today's dynamic business environment, being able to respond to changing market conditions and customer needs is crucial. Agile provides the flexibility to adapt and pivot as needed.

Improving product quality: Continuous feedback and testing throughout the Agile development process lead to higher quality products that better meet user needs.
