### What is Google Vertex AI?
Unified AI Platform: Vertex AI consolidates various tools and services for AI and ML into a single platform, making it easier for users to manage the entire machine learning lifecycleâ€”from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring 14.
Generative AI Capabilities: It includes over 100 foundation models, allowing users to build generative applications quickly and efficiently 

## Use Cases for Google Vertex AI

Data Preparation: Tools for cleaning, transforming, and managing datasets to ensure high-quality input for ML models.
Model Training: Supports AutoML for automated model creation and custom training options using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch 56.
Experiment Tracking: Users can organize and compare different model iterations through Vertex AI Experiments.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Vertex Vizier helps optimize model configurations for improved performance.
Model Deployment: Offers flexible deployment options, including API endpoints for real-time predictions and batch processing 14.
Model Monitoring: Tools to track model performance, detect issues like data drift, and ensure consistent quality in predictions
