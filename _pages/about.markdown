### Who We Are
Inspired by the harmonious collaboration found in music, Songpoem embodies the essence of teamwork and creativity. Just as a song is crafted through the synergy of lyrics, instruments, and refinement, we believe that building intelligent products requires a similar collaborative spirit. Our team comprises highly skilled professionals who specialize in niche technologies, making it easier for startups to access the expertise they need at competitive prices.
